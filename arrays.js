'Sweaty circles of people professing their love contrasted the disassociated.'],

['In an events based culture such as this, the idea of not being intoxicated is stupid.',
'And quite frankly scared Endon. Everything was an event and should be experienced in the widest array of states possible.',

['The athletes stayed sober.',
'They were already at their peak physiological states.'],

['Then the music started. The dance floor was filled in a gradient from uppers on the right to downers on the left. The music matched this arrangement. Ambient effects played at one end, bass and drums at the other.',

'This didn’t stop them trying to figure it out.'],

['Who knew what time went where?',
'Probably not Endon.'],

['The clock revolved around its hands, telling the watcher the whenabouts according to it’s whereabouts.  As the Earth revolves around the sun the moon revolves around the Earth.',
'We can feel the revolutions, yet why does today’s feel more substantial than that of yesterday’s?'],

['I’m so bored.',
'Overstimulated.'],

['Apart from the transition from light to dark and back again, the clock seems to be the only defining feature of the when we are now a resident of.',
'If we travelled around the world fast enough would it be constantly light or dark?'],

['Maybe we should try it and report back.',
'All talk.'],

['Perhaps a flexible alternative is needed. Something intensive.',
'Why within the 10 seconds to midnight on new years eve, does more intensity fill the room than that of every other day of the year?'],

['New Years eve. The prescription of a time. A time to kiss and to drink and to sing.',

' Heritage buildings were knocked down or reoccupied.'],

[' Speakers were mounted 360 degrees around a central audience.',
'Smells were secreted from special ducts in the ceiling.'],

['The audience were required to shower before visiting. After they left, would carry the many scents of the film around with them.',
'This allowed the film to leak outside of the cinema. '],

['In turn smell gained a new role within society.',

['A small escape door opened into a room of paintings',
'Escape was a generous term. Endon didn’t like painting at all.'],

['The limits of painting seem to have been reached.',
'In a world of drones and pornography, painted images don’t hold as much power as they were once supposed to.'],

['They exist within gloss, satin and matte.',

['As a mode of image creation, painting is no longer a competitor.',
'It trips itself up.'],

['Perhaps we could imagine a new mode of painting.',
'Sounds messy.'],

['Functional painting.',
'Sounds didactic.',

['It is functional in the sense that it exists in relation to behaviour.',
'Endon is a prime example of why a human centred approach may be short sighted.'],

['What is to stop sound becoming architecture?',
'A corridor that constantly emits the sound of rain. A software dimension to architecture.'],

['Technologically and mentally.',
'Perhaps architects of the built world should have discussions with designers of user interfaces.'],

['A new politics of UI design should first be established.',
'UI is all about domination and control.'],

['Rather than changing space via behaviour or changing behaviour via space, space and behaviour could exist intra-actively. ',
'Narrative measurement.'],

'Solutions seem to create problems.'],

['Or maybe, the sound of the car could be whatever the driver is listening to at the time?',
