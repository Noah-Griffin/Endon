['Some context.',
'Upon entering the room, separate groups of people had already flocked together into different sections of the space with the others floating in between.'],

['Maybe it’s useful to start from before, considering some of the most basic means of public communication.',
'Everyone had already decided socially where they were situated.'],

['Before most of the general public was literate, pictorial/phonetic signage was used as a means of identification.',
'The groups were distinguishable by their style of dress. '],

['Houses, shops and other physical locations were named with shapes and colours.',
'Endon felt alien. '],

['However, due to the smallness of cities and the lack of accessible public transport, this form of communication doesn’t actually appear to be that inefficient as colloquialisms form through the communities around the signs.',
'70’s retro teenagers, reviving their parents wardrobes.'],

['As spaces grew and mobility increased, these colloquialisms threaten to confuse the outsider.',
'Middle aged, melting punks.'],

['Numerical systems of naming sites are now introduced, allowing for easier recording, mapping, taxing and monitoring by governing bodies.',
'Uniformed personnel (they liked being told to tell people what to do)',
'bottom', 'https://www.amazon.co.uk/Amosfun-Lingerie-Policeman-Underwear-Boyfriends/dp/B08253F4N3/ref=sr_1_16?crid=28WXRGV1A3DO7&dchild=1&keywords=sexy+police+outfit&qid=1620296419&sprefix=sexy+police%2Caps%2C156&sr=8-16'],

['We see here the adoption of a dominant language by the masses that offers both efficiency and increased manageability. ',
'People who wore something that couldn’t be described yet.'],

['This efficiency has been picked up and hailed by the romantic-utopian modernists through manifestos, proposals and practice, a form-follows-function utilitarianism that has carried through into current digital spaces.',
'Rich people who didn’t want you to know it.'],

['Fast forward to a postmodern rejection of this structurally enforced efficiency.',
'Athletes warming up.'],

['We are faced with an issue of measurement.',
'Everyone drank orange juice mixed with whatever substances they decided to bring. This resulted in a wide array of behaviour to be exhibited during the course of the night.'],

['One example to consider may be the 24 hour clock.',
'Everyone knew their limits.',
'bottom', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=azwXuTIEyto'],

['Fast forward to the rave.',
'In an events based culture, the idea of not being intoxicated is ridiculous.'],

['I’m not old enough to have actually experienced the rave generation of the late 80’s early 90’s.',
'The athletes stayed sober. They were already at their peak physiological states.'],

['I’ve just heard myths.',
'Then the music started. The dance floor was filled in a gradient from uppers on the right to downers on the left.',
'bottom', 'https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~galles/visualization/ComparisonSort.html'],

['Secret phone lines and locations, peer to peer flyers.',
'The music matched this arrangement. Ambient effects played at one end, bass and drums at the other. A spectrum of intensity.'],

['A kind of clandestine, colloquial organisation of people looking for a good time.',
'The adventurous ones who dared to move further right quickly returned to their original positions.'],

['The utopian dreams of that generation still flicker in those that experienced it.',
'It wasn’t sure what era the music came from. Could’ve been 90s, 00’s, 10’s or 20’s.'],

['When I talk to my dad about it I get excited by the optimism that I can tell he once held.',
'Locating it wouldn’t have given it anymore significance. And people were too far gone to care.',
'bottom', 'https://www.shazam.com/gb'],

['At the same time however, I can’t help but cringe at some of it.',
'It was tinged with this sickly feeling that it wanted you to like it. Someone should have asked it: ‘how can I love you when you can’t love yourself?’'],

['Theres a kind of naivety to it all.',
'The walls moved around to form small alcoves where people could sit and have private conversations about important things like work, movies or the environment.'],

['A pseudo-spiritual-political vagueness that should have changed the world by itself and didn’t.',
'These conversations were mainly for show and didn’t last long. Endon hated being asked what he did.'],

['This isn’t to say that rave died out by itself.',
'Endon was a writer but distinctly not an author. He had no authority contrary to popular belief.',
'top', 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_Tribe'],

['Legislation and heavy policing seemed an effective method of trampling the could-be revolutionary dreams of the 90s youth by a confused and potentially paranoid government.',
'He preferred the title writer because of the mechanical implications it carried. Information was presented to him and he translated it into his writing like a cog transferring energy.'],

['The illegal side-of-the-motorway parties dissipated into the clubs of the inner city where drinks could be sold, entrants could be searched and venues could be regulated.',
'Who is to say the time can be regulated and divided by machines?'],

['Technology seems to provide the means to generate subcultures across a worldwide network that have been suppressed.',
'Fictionalised measurement, although initially confusing, allowed Endon some detours from the 24 hour day cycle.'],

['But in a time where we protest for the right to protest, how do we snap out of this kinky relationship we have with the powers that be?',
'The world made up of fictionalised measurements but they are usually assigned from above.',
'top', 'https://bills.parliament.uk/bills/2839'],

['We have been completely enveloped by this strict syntax.',
'Electric cars emulating a noise they don’t produce.'],

['A down-on-one-knee proposal:',
'What if they sounded like cats purring?',
