['Upon entering the room, separate groups of people had already flocked together into different sections of the space with the others floating in between.',
'Everyone had already decided socially where they were situated.'],

['The groups were distinguishable by their style of dress.',
'Endon felt alien.', 'bottom', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRvfxWRi6qQ'],

['70’s retro teenagers.',
'Reviving their parents wardrobes.'],

['People who all wore t-shirts with black squares where there should be a logo.',
'Apparently a statement.'],

['Middle aged, melting punks.',
'They had failed to break the system.'],

['Uniformed personnel.',
'They liked being told to tell people what to do.'],

['People who wore something that couldn’t be described yet.',
'Yet it actually felt very familiar.'],

['Rich people.',
'Who didn’t want you to know it.'],

['Athletes.',
'Warming up.'],

['Everyone drank orange juice mixed with whatever styles of drug they decided to bring. This resulted in a wide array of behaviour to be exhibited during the course of the night.',
'Everyone knew their limits.'],

['The groups separated and reformed based on the human-chemical hybrids that had emerged.',
'Sweaty circles of people professing their love contrasted the disassociated.'],

['In an events based culture, the idea of not being intoxicated is ridiculous.',
'And quite frankly scared Endon. Everything was an event and should be experienced in the widest array of states possible.'],

['The athletes stayed sober.',
'They were already at their peak physiological states.'],

['Then the music started. The dance floor was filled in a gradient from uppers on the right to downers on the left. The music matched this arrangement. Ambient effects played at one end, bass and drums at the other.',
'A spectrum of intensity.'],

['The energy of the room trickled down from right to left.',
'It was loaned and passed down from those on your right to those on your left. Everyone sat within their space.'],

['The adventurous ones who dared to move further right quickly returned to their original positions.',
'Equilibrium.'],

['The middle was the sweet spot for the perfectionist.',
'If you span around as quickly as you could, the song sounded even. But this was besides the point.'],

['It wasn’t sure what era the music came from. Could’ve been 90s, 00’s, 10’s or 20’s.',
'Locating it wouldn’t have given it anymore significance. And people were too far gone to care.'],

['It was tinged with this sickly feeling that it wanted you to like it. Someone should have asked it: how can I love you when you can’t love yourself?',
'It’s not me its you.'],

['At one point the music stopped and 3 band members got up on stage. One played the theremin, one played the trombone, the other played the pheromone.',
'The 3rd was definitely the sex appeal.'],

['They each wore t-shirts that displayed vaguely provocative 4 letter words.',
'The words need not be spelled out.'],

['The walls moved around to form small alcoves where people could sit and have private conversations about important things like work, movies or the environment.',
'These conversations were mainly for show and didn’t last long.'],

['Endon hated being asked what he did.',
'He was hesitant to even call it work. Certainly not a career.'],

['Endon was a writer but distinctly not an author.',
'He had no authority contrary to popular belief.'],

['He preferred the title writer because of the mechanical implications it carried. Information was presented to him and he translated it into his writing.',
'From the outside, it was known that information was lost in translation but he couldn’t help it.'],

['People often felt paranoid about what Endon wrote about them but due to his foreign language, they couldn’t actually know what was said or not said.',
'This didn’t stop them trying to figure it out.']
